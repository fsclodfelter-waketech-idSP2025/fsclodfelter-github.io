## About Me
I’m Sam a Marine Corps veteran, and I have a degree in Simulation and Game Design. With the massive layoffs and lack of new jobs in video games, I’ve decided to return to school to get a degree in Cybersecurity.
## My Interests
 I enjoy 3d modeling/ digital sculpting and 3d printing my own models and ones from the internet. I sell some of my own models online as well as making models for other companies that sell models/figures.
